# PYBER

PROJECT NAME: Power of Plots  
DESCRIPTION: Homework #5  Data Analytics Boot Camp  
DUE: 27FEB2019
PROGRAMMER:  Eric Staveley  MWSa Session  
SUMMARY:  The student is to choose one of the two scenarios for submission.  

_Pyber_ was chosen for this submission.

Input Files located at the root level of the github repo url:

* `README.md` (this file).  Describes project
* `Pyber.ipynb`             - jupyter notebook file.  Constains data summary in MarkDown at top of file
* `data\city_data.csv`      - data file 1
* `data\ride_deat.csv`      - data file 2

Ouput files will be generated at root level of this github repo url:
* `Figures\RideSharingDataDistribution.png` (bubble plot)
* `Figures\DriversByCityType.png` (pie chart)
* `Figures\FaresByCityType.png` (pie chart)
* `Figures\RidesByCityType.png` (pie chart)

README.md` (this file).  Describes project
* `Pyber.ipynb`             - jupyter notebook file.  Constains data summary in MarkDown at top of file
* `data\city_data.csv`      - data file 1
* `data\ride_deat.csv`      - data file 2

Pyber.ipynb should be opened with jupyter notebook.
The application references 2 csv files (city_data.csv  and  ride_data.csv) located in the data directory
which is at the same level as the sourced .py file.

The application will merge the data files and analyze the input data from the file and provide data analysis throughout
the jupyter notebook file.

## Pyber Data Overview Analysis (also included in the ipynb file)

There are considerably more urban riders than rural riders.  The average fare for the rural customers is significantly higher #than the fares observed in the suburban and urban areas.  Both of these observations seem logical given longer distances #required for driving to urban areas and that population density is greater in an urban area, thus more customers are available #for ride sharing.

The uban areas also have a considerably higher driver count (80% of all drivers) than the other two regions, where suburb and #rural fares consisted of only 20% of the total rides.  Again, this is logical, given that the demand for rides would be higher #in a more population-densre region.

Once can conclude that while distance of the ride may appear to be a large contributing factor to fare amount from the bubble #plot, it would be interesting to determine average fare distance and compare the scatter of the data for the three types.  #Another interesting graph would be fare amount vs miles travelled by region type.
